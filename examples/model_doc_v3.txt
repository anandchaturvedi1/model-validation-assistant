Model Name: Market Risk Exposure Estimation Model

Purpose:
To estimate potential losses in the trading portfolio under adverse market conditions, assisting risk managers in assessing and managing market risk exposure.

Input Features:  

Value at Risk (VaR) Factors for Equities, Fixed Income, Commodities, and FX
Historical Price Volatility
Correlation Matrices between Asset Classes
Market Indices and Benchmark Data
Current Portfolio Composition and Positions
Stress Scenario Parameters

Output:  

Estimated Potential Loss (e.g., VaR at 99% confidence level)
Risk Contribution by Asset Class
Scenario Loss Estimates

Model Type:
Quantitative simulation using Monte Carlo methods and Historical Simulation

Training Data:
Historical market data over the past 10 years, including prices, volatilities, and correlations across asset classes.

Model Performance Metrics:  
Backtested VaR Coverage: 97% (i.e., losses exceeded VaR in 3% of tests)
Stability of Risk Estimates over Rolling Periods

Usage Notes:  

The model provides estimates based on current market data and stress scenarios.
Regular updates to market data and model parameters are essential.
Use in conjunction with other risk management tools for comprehensive assessment.

Limitations:  

Model assumptions may not fully capture extreme or unprecedented market events.
Past data may not predict future market movements accurately.
